Phala is a Tsonga word for "Close". The application is a government intiative to address the pothole problem in South Africa by allowing citizens to take and upload pictures of potholes into a system that will use AI to grade the severity of the pothole and send someoneon out if the pothole is determined by the AI to be a severe grade pothole.
